           <div>
            Storytelling is timeless; an activity that has been taking place for hundreds & thousands of years. Stories are an integral 
            part of human history & culture with written & verbal tales passed down from generation to generation.
            A photograph will capture & freeze a moment in time whilst conveying an emotion, expressing a mood, sharing an idea & telling a narrative.
            All key elements of storytelling.

            <br><br>
            <h3 >THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN PLANNING YOUR PHOTO STORY:</h3><br>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your story about?</li>
            <li> Who is in your story? Do you need to involve other people?</li>
            <li> What research is needed? Is your story about a subject you are familiar with?</li>
            <li> What equipment will you need? With careful planning, almost everything could be shot on a simple phone camera.</li>
            <li> Where & when are you going to shoot your narrative?</li>


          </ul>
          <br>

            <ul>

             <li>A suitcase & train ticket illustrating the start of a journey.  </li>

            </li><br>
            <li><u>IDEAS FOR CONCLUSION SHOTS</u></li><br>
           <ol>
           <li>Sunset at the end of your travels (although this could be considered a cliche shot!)  </li>
           <li>The blowing out of candles on a birthday cake, the end of a year  </li>

              <li>A happy client</li>

             <h3>THEMES</h3><br>
          <p>To keep your story interesting, you should aim for variety in your images. However, you also want visual consistency to create 
             a cohesive story. 
             Consider visual or stylistic themes that you could interweave throughout your story to tie your images together.
